#GT Traj

This is a fork of the [`trajectories`](https://github.com/tobiaskunz/trajectories) repo which is based on the article [*Time-Optimal Trajectory Generation for Path Following with Bounded Acceleration and Velocity*](https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/44347/KunzRSS12-Trajectories.pdf) by Tobias Kunz and Mike Stilman.

I forked it to test its integration with [`ocra`](http://ocra-recipes.github.io/ocra-wbi-plugins/).

## Changes
- [x] CMake configuration for cross-platform builds
- [ ] Update for GCC/G++5 (C++11 standard)
